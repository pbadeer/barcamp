# BarCamp Omaha

This is the website for barcampomaha.org. Read on to learn how the website is built.

## Goals of the Codebase

- Easy for a new developer to begin making changes
- Resistant to obsolescence (minimal dependencies, trust the tried & true)
- Making content changes is easy enough for the moderately technical
- Easy to deploy
- Easy to archive (i.e. for the archive of each year's BarCamp design)
- Fully static site to reduce the need for server-side caching and database calls
